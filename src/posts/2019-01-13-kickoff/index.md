Today I decided to look into what legislation had been filed on the
[Utah Legislature website](https://le.utah.gov) to determine a good one to
track.

## The Bill

I found one that I think is interesting.
[H.B. 45 Higher Education Credit Amendments](https://le.utah.gov/~2019/bills/static/HB0045.html)
is a bill relating to the treatment of credits in higher education. The key
pieces I'm most interested in deal with credits for prior learning.

## Sponsors

The bill was introduced by [Val L. Peterson](http://house.utah.gov/rep/PETERVL)
and is sponsored in the Senate by
[Ann Millner](https://senate.utah.gov/ann-millner), both Republicans with
professions in the education realm.

## Status

It seems that the bill has been sent through the normal pre-debate steps and is
currently awaiting debate at the time of this writing.

I look forward to digging in more to the meat of this bill and seeing where
things end up by the end of the session.
