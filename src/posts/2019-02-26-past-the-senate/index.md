Since the last post, the bill managed to pass through it's 2nd reading and 3rd
reading in the Senate.

It passed the 2nd reading vote
[28-0-1](https://le.utah.gov/DynaBill/svotes.jsp?sessionid=2019GS&voteid=298&house=S)
and it also passed the 3rd reading with the same
[28-0-1](https://le.utah.gov/DynaBill/svotes.jsp?sessionid=2019GS&voteid=325&house=S)
just with Senator Bramble being absent or not voting in place of Senator Grover.

The bill has now been drafted as an enrolled bill. Once the draft is finalized
it'll be off to Governor Herbert for his signature.
