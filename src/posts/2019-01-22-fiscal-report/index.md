The fiscal report came back for H.B. 45. It was made publicly available on
2019-01-16. I love that this is something that gets put out for all to see.

The report itself was great. The bill was deemed to have no impact on the
revenue the state generates. It also has no effect on the expenditures of the
state. Anytime something meets those qualifications it seems that it is a lot
easier to get good support from all involved.

I continue to be excited to see where this bill ends up.
