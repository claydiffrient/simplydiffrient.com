    <h2>Leadership in IDET - Utah Legislature Tracking</h2>
    <p>
      This blog follows my learnings about a piece of legislature brought
      forward during the 2019 general session of the Utah Legislature. It is a
      project for my Leadership in IDET course (ED PS 6445) being completed in
      Spring 2019 at the University of Utah.
